• Define Monolithic architecture
\nIs unified architecture where there is no separation between services or components of the application. 
Horizontal scaling and vertical scaling are for scalability in Monolithic architecture. 
Horizontal scaling - adding  more servers. The strategy involves decreasing the server’s load . 
vertical scaling - adding more server resources to your existing server. The strategy involves expanding the capacity of the individual server.


• Explain microservices in your own understanding
\nMicroservices are pieces of a larger application. They are split into a collection of smaller independent units. These units carry out every application process as a separate service.Each service covers its own scope and can be updated, deployed, and scaled independently.


• Which of the backend architecture appeals to you and why?
\nMicroservices architecture
\nIt appeals to me due to the following: 
1. Need to develop a scalable application. 
2. Plan to release new features often. As a developer I can build and deploy new functionalities separately in each service without a need to redesign the whole solution.
3. Aiming at increasing fault tolerance.  If one system component fails, the other application parts won’t stop working properly.
4. Use several technologies within one software. The isolation of modules enables you to choose the most appropriate technology for each service—and they won’t contradict.
